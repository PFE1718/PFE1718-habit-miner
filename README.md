# habit-miner skill

The habit-miner skill is part of a project aiming to detect user habits and allow their automation.
This skill allows the user to automate some of his/her habits that Mycroft has detected and handles the automation.

The habit detection is done by two complementary skills:
- The skill-listener, that logs the user actions locally
- The habit-miner, that uses Data Mining to extract the habits from the logs

The automation-handler skill then interacts with the user to automate habits.
